# 📘 Comparative Analysis of Traditional and Deep Learning-Based Recommendation Systems  
### 🧠 A Case Study in E-Learning Platforms

> This repository presents a comparative analysis and implementation of traditional and deep learning–based recommendation systems in the context of **e-learning platforms**.  
> The project was conducted as part of a **Diploma in University Technology (Computer Engineering)** under the supervision of **Dr. Abdelali Ibriz** at the **Higher School of Technology of Fez (University Mohamed Ben Abdellah)**.

## 🧩 Overview

In today's digital learning landscape, **recommendation systems (RS)** are essential for personalizing educational content and improving learner engagement.  
This research project explores both **traditional recommendation methods** (rule-based, content-based, and collaborative filtering) and **deep learning–based models** (LDA, LSTM with Attention, Self-Attention, and Neural Collaborative Filtering).

The study evaluates the performance, scalability, and personalization capabilities of each approach to determine how deep learning can enhance learning experiences on e-learning platforms.

## 🎯 Research Objectives

- Analyze and compare traditional vs deep learning recommendation systems.  
- Implement multiple algorithms for both approaches.  
- Evaluate model performance, scalability, and personalization.  
- Design a hybrid recommendation model using a **switching mechanism** between algorithms.

## ⚙️ System Architecture

### 🧮 Traditional Methods
1. **Knowledge-Based Recommendation (Rule-Based System)**  
   - Uses predefined rules to recommend courses based on user category.  
   - Limited scalability and adaptability.  

2. **Content-Based Recommendation (TF-IDF)**  
   - Recommends similar courses based on text descriptions using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.  
   - Faces cold-start and limited personalization issues.  

3. **Collaborative Filtering (KNN)**  
   - Recommends courses based on user-course interaction similarities.  
   - Suffers from data sparsity and scalability limitations.  

### 🤖 Deep Learning Methods
1. **Knowledge-Based (LDA + Neural Network)**  
   - Extracts latent topics from course descriptions using LDA.  
   - Classifies and recommends courses using an NLP-based neural network.  

2. **Content-Based (LSTMWithAttention & SelfAttention)**  
   - Predicts next-course recommendations based on user viewing sequences.  
   - Combines LSTM with an attention mechanism for better focus on important features.  

3. **Collaborative-Based (Neural Collaborative Filtering - NCF)**  
   - Learns non-linear user-item interactions through embeddings and deep neural networks.  
   - Achieves higher personalization accuracy.  

4. **Hybrid Switching Mechanism**  
   - Dynamically selects the most suitable model based on user interaction level:  
     - Low interaction → Knowledge-Based  
     - Medium interaction → Content-Based  
     - High interaction → Collaborative-Based
